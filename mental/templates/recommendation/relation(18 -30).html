            There comes a time in every relationship when a screwup can't be covered by a simple sorry. Chapman and Thomas break down what makes for a meaningful apology, and how to potentially fix relationships—from romantic partners to friends and family—that feel strained. Can you guess what that includes? Yup, honesty, the trait that Campbell says is important in every bond we share.</li><br>

            Tiny Beautiful Things </a></strong> by Cheryl Strayed<br>
            Cheryl Strayed may be most famous for writing "Wild", but before she had a recognizable name, she was the anonymous advice columnist for The Rumpus. Her book "Tiny Beautiful Things" compiles the questions she received and the heartfelt advice she gave under the pen name Sugar, as well as essays she wrote about her own experiences. It's a mix of memoir and universal self-help that'll inspire personal growth and empathy for others.</li><br>
