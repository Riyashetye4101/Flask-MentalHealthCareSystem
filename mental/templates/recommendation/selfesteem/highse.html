      <h2>Self-Esteem Building Activity and Exercise</h2>
      <button class="accordion">Activity #1:Act With Intention</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p><ul><li>Acting with intention means setting boundaries to enforce your priorities and then staying focused on those priorities so
          that you can get the things that are most important to you done (instead of always pushing them to the bottom of a long list of unimportant to-do’s).</li>
        <li>If you want to act with more intention, start by asking yourself some questions:
          <ol><li>What are your core personal values?</li>
          <li>What do you want and why (and how does this relate to your values)?</li>
          <li>What are your strengths – and how might you leverage them to help you?</li>
          <li>What weaknesses do you have (that you’ll want to enlist help for or plan around)?</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Use this information to your benefit to create an overarching, values-based vision and plan of action.
           And then follow your plan of action by building boundaries, saying no and blocking off time for your priorities.</li>
        </ul>
        </p></div>
        <button class="accordion">Activity #2: Create Self-Care Routines and Rituals</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <ul><li>
            Self-care involves taking care of your mental, spiritual, and physical well-being. It’s about respecting yourself.</li>
       <li>Taking good care of yourself increases your sense of self-worth and self-respect. And it also increases your confidence because you’re more capable of performing well </li>
         <li>[Recommended Reading:<a href="https://www.coursecorrectioncoaching.com/guilty-taking-care-of-yourself/"> 5 Reasons You Feel Guilty About Taking Care of Yourself (and What to Do About It)].</a></li> </ul>
        </p></div>

      <button class="accordion">Activity #3: Focus on Your Body Language</button>
      <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Change your body language for more positivity by:
            <ul><li>Smiling often</li>
            <li>Taking an expansive posture (also known as a power pose).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
       </div>
      <button class="accordion">Activity #4: Affirm Yourself</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The point of adopting positive affirmations is to build new neural pathways within your brain to crowd out the negative thoughts and replace them (over time) with self-empowering thoughts.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Activity #5: Playfully Challenge Yourself</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The best way to grow your self-confidence is by overcoming adversity and/or rising to a new challenge.
          So, by challenging yourself you’ll naturally grow your self-confidence. And what makes this more fun (and less scary) is the fact that you’ll be doing something that’s interesting to you.
