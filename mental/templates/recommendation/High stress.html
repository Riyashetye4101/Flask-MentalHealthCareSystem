        <p>In mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass through your mind. You don’t judge the thoughts or become involved with them. You simply observe and take note of any patterns.<br>

            This practice combines concentration with awareness. You may find it helpful to focus on an object or your breath while you observe any bodily sensations, thoughts, or feelings.<br>

        <p>Spiritual meditation is used in Eastern religions, such as Hinduism and Daoism, and in Christian faith.<br>

            It’s similar to prayer in that you reflect on the silence around you and seek a deeper connection with your God or Universe.<br>

            Essential oils are commonly used to heighten the spiritual experience. Popular options include:
            <ul>
            <li>frankincense</li>
            <li>myrrh</li>

            For example, you can focus on something internal, like your breath, or you can bring in external influences to help focus your attention.<br>

            Try counting mala beads, listening to a gong, or staring at a candle flame.</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=122276X1582760&isjs=1&jv=15.2.0-stackpath&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inc.com%2Fgeoffrey-james%2F7-short-books-that-quickly-reduce-stress.html&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTaming-Your-Gremlin-Surprisingly-Getting%2Fdp%2F0060520221%2F%3Ftag%3Dwwwinccom-20&xguid=01FFSKDVVMKP6RNESHHB3Q17H3&xs=1&xtz=-330&xuuid=764730b426a094c83507e855522923a8&xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">Taming Your Gremlin</a></p>
      <p><strong>How it reduces stress:</strong> Stress is always the result of how you're interpreting the events in your life. Stress affects you only insofar as you believe that that interpretation represents reality. This book (which you can read in about two hours) shows you that it's not just possible but extremely easy to ignore that part of your brain that's constantly interpreting things, thereby eliminating the source of your stress.<br>

        <strong>Best quote:</strong> "Your gremlin is the narrator in your head. He has influenced you since you came into this world, and he accompanies you throughout your entire existence. He's with you when you wake up in the morning and when you go to sleep at night. He tells you who and how you are, and he defines and interprets your every experience. He wants you to accept his interpretations as reality, and his goal, from moment to moment, day to day, is to squelch the natural vibrant you within..."</p>

    <p><strong>How it reduces stress:</strong>While the previous book relieves stress by creating an awareness of (and an ability to ignore) the inner voice that's making you miserable, this book subverts the "gremlin" head-on by providing a new and much-less-stressful perspective on the events in our lives that we use to create stress. Hint: Read the whole book and then get a "stress-relieving boost" by reading specific chapters when you encounter those specific situations. <br>

      <strong>Best quote:</strong>"There is another way to relate to life--a softer, more graceful path that makes life seem easier and the people in it more compatible. This 'other way' of living involves replacing old habits of 'reaction' with new habits of perspective. These new habits enable us to have richer, more satisfying lives."</p>

        <p><strong>How it reduces stress:</strong> While reading the classic Holy Books can relieve stress, the Torah, the Bible, and the Koran are lengthy and complex books and can take a lifetime to understand. By contrast, the Tao Te Ching is a one-hour read, isn't connected to any (organized) religion, and helps you understand that stress and the busywork it generates are things that you're doing to yourself and can be easily avoided.<br>

            <strong>Best quote:</strong> "Simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures. Simple in actions and thoughts, you return to the source of being. Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are. Compassionate toward yourself, you reconcile all beings in the world."</p>

                <p><strong>How it reduces stress:</strong>Laughter is a well-known stress reliever but while there are hundreds of great comedians and countless funny movies, there are few books that can summon more than an occasional chuckle. Jack Handey (some might remember him from the "Deep Thoughts" segments on Saturday Night Live) somehow manages to be ROFL funny with nearly every paragraph. Read any chapter at random (they're all really short) and chances are you'll immediately interrupt whatever stressful thoughts were giving you grief.<br>

                    <strong>Best quote:</strong> "I remember when we were kids, one of our favorite games was to play 'pirate.' We'd dress up like pirates. Then we'd go find an adult walking down the street and we'd go up to him and pull out our butcher knives, which we called 'swords,' and say, 'We're pirates! Give us your money!' A lot of adults would pretend to be scared and give us their money. Others would suddenly run away, yelling for help. We played pirate until we were twenty or so."</p>

                    <p><strong>How it reduces stress:</strong>For a thousand years of European history, this was the go-to book for achieving life wisdom. While it's not the easiest read (it's a dialog between the writer and the goddess of philosophy), The Consolation is short and to the point and it deals with the "big issues" that create huge stress, like why bad things happen to good people. Ironically, it was written while the author was in prison and he was executed soon after completing it.<br>

                        <strong>Best quote:</strong>"You think that the goddess Fortune has abandoned you, but it is only in change that She shows consistency. That was true when She caressed you and seduced you with false happiness. Consider yourself lucky to have discovered Her true character. If you love Her gifts, take Her as She is and stop complaining! If you don't, then renounce Her and Her delusions. The events that bring you grief today will bring you tranquility once you realized you've been forsaken by the blind goddess who eventually forsakes everyone." </p>

                        <p><strong>How it reduces stress:</strong>There are hundreds of how-to books about stress reduction. Many of them, though, offer advice that simply adds to already too-full to-do list, like "exercise for an hour every day." (Like that's going to happen.) This book is different. It contains easily followed scripts (also on an accompanying CD) that guide you from being stressed to being calm. When it comes to stress, this book is the closest thing to a "magic bullet" that you're likely to find.<br>

                            <strong>Best quote:</strong> "When stressors are as frequent and as pervasive as they seem to be in our modern world, our bodies do not have enough time to reverse the harmful physiological effects. We are bathed in stress hormones, and we pay a huge physical and mental price. For these reasons, learning to rapidly reduce stress levels, both mentally and physically, is vitally important." </p>

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <button class="accordion">1. Marconi Union, “Weightless”</button>
      <div class="panel">

        <p>Marconi Union is an English ambient music band that worked with sound therapists to create what is known as the most relaxing song in the world. The song actually induced a 65 percent reduction in overall stress among participants.<br>
            The song contains a sustaining rhythm that starts at 60 beats per minute and gradually slows to around 50. While listening, your heart rate gradually comes to match that beat.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">2. Airstream, “Electra”</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A4c5NPPndaEkb0dUVYFlKlT" width="100%" height="100" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
      <p>The tempo matches the optimal resting heart rate of 60 to 65 beats per minute. The mid-range frequencies and absence of a low, heavy bass is less taxing on the nervous system.<br>

        This song definitely has a “chiller” vibe to it, and it has more of a hip-hop beat, but nothing to the extreme. Yoga fans might find this the perfect background music for their sun salutations.</p>
  </div>
  <button class="accordion">3. Coldplay, “Strawberry Swing”</button>

        <p>This is the first relaxing song on the list with lyrics, which proves that music does not have to be instrumental to be soothing. It has a slightly higher tempo and does not really promote relaxation so much as a feeling of contentment.</p>

Walking can also be done by just about anyone in any age group and at any level of fitness.

Walking has been shown to be good for joint pain relief, stress relief, and has even been shown to provide benefits for individuals who suffer from rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

In addition, because swimming removes much of the burden of your body weight on your back and spine, it can be a great way to relieve back pain while still getting great exercise. Most doctors suggest doing aerobic exercises like swimming between three and five times a week for about half an hour to an hour per session.</p>

         <div class="panel">
             <p>While you probably are not going to be able to go spend time in the great outdoors on a regular basis, many studies have shown that even taking a few days off a couple of times a year in order to go hiking, taking up gardening, or doing another similar outdoor activity can be an excellent way to reduce stress and get exercise. You may want to consider visiting a state or national park for a few days with some friends and family.

                 <p>Attempt a new outdoor activity you’ve always wanted to try like rowing, Pilates in the park, or mountain biking. Look to your friends or local community for inspired team leagues like kickball or Frisbee golf to keep you active. Research proves that exercising outdoors has a positive impact on blood pressure, lung function, sleep, and stress. Plus vitamin D from the sun naturally helps your body regulate insulin and calcium, aiding in the prevention of diabetes and osteoporosis.</p>

             <div class="panel">
                 <p>One way to handle stress is to write things down.

                  While recording what you’re stressed about is one approach, another is jotting down what you’re grateful for.

                  Gratitude may help relieve stress and anxiety by focusing your thoughts on what’s positive in your life.</p>
