  <h2>Do’s And Don’ts (Widowed)</h2>
  <p>
      <ul>
          <li>First Relationship After Being Widowed- Do’s And Don’ts:</li>
<ol>
           <li>Ask yourself if you have overcome the tragedy:<br>
            Before embarking on any serious relationship, ensure that your grief period after losing a spouse is well and truly over. It would not be fair on the other person to get into a rebound relationship after death of a loved one.

            The worst mistake you can make is to seek a replacement for the loss because you can’t stand the idea of being alone. This is how you end up making mistakes and regretting getting into a wrong relationship.</li><br>
           <li>Realise if you are emotionally ready<br>
            You might be open to the idea of dating but are you emotionally ready to offer a commitment? If you are still haunted by the memories of your former partner, if small triggers upset you and you feel hesitant to get intimate with anyone else, it’s a sign that you are still not over your ex.

            In this case, it might be worth your while to give yourself some time before entering a new relationship or at least plunging deeply into one. You should of course, be open to meeting people and seeking out companionship or at least enjoy a good, healthy friendship.</li><br>
           <li>Don’t feel guilty<br>
            First and foremost, remove guilt from your mind. Do not feel embarrassed about wanting to date again. When you go out with a new person and it ends up in you getting your first kiss after widowhood, the intimacy may definitely lead to some confusion within you.
            </li><br>
            <li>Decide to what extent you want to reveal yourself<br>
              Remember that the person you are now seeing is coming from a different space and place. When you enter your first relationship after being widowed, it is natural to unburden your pain onto him.

              But it’s always best to approach this a bit carefully and take your time into revealing too much about yourself or your past. Decide beforehand what you want to share with him and what you would rather keep for later. You may open up slowly as you get more comfortable.</li>

            There comes a time in every relationship when a screwup can't be covered by a simple sorry. Chapman and Thomas break down what makes for a meaningful apology, and how to potentially fix relationships—from romantic partners to friends and family—that feel strained. Can you guess what that includes? Yup, honesty, the trait that Campbell says is important in every bond we share.</li><br>

            Tiny Beautiful Things </a></strong> by Cheryl Strayed<br>

Her book "Tiny Beautiful Things" compiles the questions she received and the heartfelt advice she gave under the pen name Sugar, as well as essays she wrote about her own experiences. It's a mix of memoir and universal self-help that'll inspire personal growth and empathy for others.</li><br>
